AngularJS v 1 to Angular 2+ Guide & References
========
  You have three options. Choose anyone
  --
  1. migrate 
      ideal steps 
      ---
        essential step: update angular js to angular js v 1.5 
        integrate angular 2+ within angular v1 app (downgrade it work with angular js v 1)
        upgrade angular js v 1.5 to angular 2+
        run the app. (dual boot)
        infect angular js v 1 with angular 2+ codebase
        trial and error  
        remove angular js at last. 
        migration ends 


  2. rewrite in Angular 2+ (expensive)
      if you have unit testing in angular js v1 app, 
        rewrite unit testing in angular 2+ (this will ensure that you will never miss out any feature )
      
      if the app is smaller to medium 
      spend lot of time in testing 
      features might be missed out 
      
      if the uniting is not there in old angular js v 1 app, 
        rewriting the code requires lot of testing. 

  3. going hybrid (angular Js vs 1 and Angular 2+ will work together)
      running both angular js v1 and angular 2+ codebase together 
      Angular 2+ (full control )

      possible disadvantages
      --- 
        performance issues 


  Understanding The differences
  ---
  Angular JS                    Angular 2+
  ---------------------------------------------
  1. Controllers              = Components 
  2. Directives with HTML     = Components 
  3. Directives without HTML  = Directives (You have to rewrite )
  4. Services                 = Services 
      Promise                 =    RxJS & Promise
  5. Factory                  = Services 
  6. Filters                  = Pipes  (You have to rewrite)
  7. Modules                  = Modules (you have to rewrite)
  
  Concepts
  8. Dependency Injection with strings  = DI with Classes or any.
  
  Syntax Differences
  =====
    ng-model  = [(ngModel)] 
    ng-if     = *ngIf 
  

  URL's 
  ---
    thinking in angular 
      identify the components
      map them to the url's 
    you decide about routing 


  Coding
  -----
  JS  = TS  

  Dependency Management
  -----
  Bower = NPM
    first opt for the exact version of the depencies during migration. 


  Build Tools
  ------
  Grunt/Gulp/Browserify = Webpack 

Note: If your app is not in AngularJs v1.5 then, you should migrate to AngularJS 1.5. 
      Because, it has components. 
      So, we can later convert AngularJS v 1.5 components to Angular 2+ Components.
      Recommending to migrate to at least AngularJS 1.5 which introduced components to 
      the AngularJS eco-system. This will make our migration process a lot easier!


How can be done?
  * Filters in AngularJS cannot be migrated and will have to be re-written as Pipes 
  during the migration process.
  * Some directives (those without templates) will need to be re-written as Angular Directives.

Let's begin..

  Let's clone Angular Js v 1 project 
    git clone https://github.com/jawache/angularjs-migration.git
